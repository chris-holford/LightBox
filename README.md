>This one is pretty specific to the Light Box I designed and built for my Best Boy's 48, and there are features not implemented because I do not work off that truck anymore and never got the chance to update the code on the teensy running it.

>I thought it would be pretty clever to group LEDs in order to extend the range of color possibilities. This might have worked, but it is hard to tell, because I used LeeLux, and that was not sufficient to blend everything together when looking at the box. If I were to build it again, I'd use a denser array of strips and not point them directly outwards. These choices were informed by a budget of $300 and having to build it on the clock while prepping for a TV show.

>It was my first time actually programming and wiring up and LCD with rotary encoders, and my first installation of a permanent teensy in an enclosure. Designing the wiring diagram, even though it was all through-hole jumpered with wires, was a fun challenge. I had 5v and 3v "rails", and an IC to translate.
